# Multi-Agent AI System (Local & Privacy-Preserving)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **local, low-cost, privacy-preserving Multi-Agent AI System** for a facility-based startup. The goal is to optimize the startup’s complete operational funnel — from customer insights and internal decision-making to investor communication and operational intelligence.

The system is built to run **entirely on local machines** with limited computational resources (8–24 GB RAM, CPU / optional GPU), while minimizing dependence on paid cloud APIs. All agents are designed using **open-source tools and models**, ensuring data privacy and accessibility.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

A facility-based startup requires an intelligent AI-driven system that can assist in analyzing customer data, improving decision-making, automating internal workflows, and supporting investor-facing operations. Traditional cloud-based AI solutions are often costly and raise privacy concerns.

This project addresses the problem by implementing a **modular multi-agent architecture** where multiple AI agents operate independently yet collaboratively to produce actionable insights and automate business processes — all in a local environment.

---

## 🤖 System Overview

The system consists of multiple AI agents, each responsible for a specific functional area such as customer analysis, forecasting, document understanding, operational monitoring, or communication automation.

Agents generate insights, scores, or alerts based on their respective inputs. These outputs are then integrated into dashboards and automated workflows to support decision-making.

## ✉️ Email Automation Integration

An Email Automation component is integrated across the system to handle:

* Alerts and notifications
* Automated reports
* Follow-up and reminder emails

This ensures that insights generated by the agents are converted into **actionable communication outputs**.
